Programming Language: Python (version >=3.6 ONLY)

Instructions:

• The main script to run is "find_route.py". 

• Before running it, make sure the Python's version is ***AT LEAST 3.6*** since f-strings are used to print the desired output. To confirm the version: "python --version". If both Python2 and Python3 exists in the system, use "python3" directly instead of just "python" command while running the script.

• Use the following format while running: "python find_route.py <input_file> (required) <source> (required) <destination> (required) <heuristic_file> (optional)". If number of arguments is insufficient except for the last one (heuristic file), then it will throw an error.
